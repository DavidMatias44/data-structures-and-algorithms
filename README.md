# Data Structures and Algorithms in C.

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of  data strucutures and algorithms using the C programming laguage.

## Compilation.
```bash
make
```

## Run.
```bash
./output
```

## Motivations.
C was the first programming language that I learned. I took a university course on data structures in my first year, and another on complexity analysis in the second year. Now, as a recent graduated (with a lot of free time), I want to revisit and deeply understand how these structures work internally. This project also helps me sharpen my problem-solving skills.

## Structures.
- Dynamic array.

## Future improvements.
- Add more data structures.
- Integrate basic testing.
- Include time/space complexity analysis.
